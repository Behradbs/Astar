This MIPS Assembly program calculates the Manhattan distance between a start (S) and goal (G) point on a 4Ã—4 grid and visualizes the grid using the MARS bitmap display. Walls (#), start, and goal are color-coded.


1. Open in MARS simulator.
2. Enable the Bitmap Display tool (set base address to 0x10008000, unit width/height = 1, display width = 64, height = 64).
3. Assemble and run.

- Console: Displays the Manhattan distance.
- Bitmap: Visualizes the grid with colored blocks.
